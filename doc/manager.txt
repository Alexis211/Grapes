The manager is a service whose role is to manage all other services. By default, all loaded modules
get a descriptor to the manager service (descriptor 1).

Each service has a set of ressources that can get a descriptor by openning them. These ressources
are identified by a string, such as :
kbd:readtext
file:root/System/
console:myuser/main

To open these objects, a process would call the open() method on the manager object. The manager would
then call the open() method on the corresponding process with the string after the first semicolon
(for example: open("file:root/System") would call file.open("root/System")).

If the string is just a service name (like open("kbd")), the manager would return a descriptor to the
root object for that service.

The manager is also the one that handle log entries for services, for the moment by printing them on the screen.
